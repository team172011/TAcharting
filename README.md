## What is TAcharting? 
_(features may be still under development)_<br/>
##### On the one hand the aim of TAcharting is to provide a self contained application for technical analysis that is easy to start and use:
 - plot financial data from CSV/Excel files 
 - connect with yahoo financial api and request financial data
 - automatically store data in database
 - add indicators and save indicator properties
 - customize indicators
 - save graph as png
 - save indicators and financial data as excel/csv
 
##### On the other hand TAcharting should stay developer friendly and give you a plurality of possibility to customize, embed or automate:
 - write your own `Indicator`s and plot them on the chart
 - write a trading [strategy](https://github.com/ta4j/ta4j/blob/master/ta4j-core/src/main/java/org/ta4j/core/Strategy.java) and let it run and plot by TAcharting
 - write additional `Connector` to connect the application other data sources
 - write your own `SQLConnector` to connect with custom database
 - write your own `SQLPropertiesManager` to store indicator parameters in a customized way
 - embed `ChartController` or `TAChart` to support your own application
